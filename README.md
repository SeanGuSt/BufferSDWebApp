# BufferSDWebApp
Once you have all of these installed:
1. Get the BufferSDWebApp files off of GitHub on your computer 
2. Open your command prompt
3. Change the directory to the folder holding "runserver.py"
4. Execute the command "python3 runserver.py"
5. If done correctly, the command prompt will say:
 * Serving Flask app 'BufferSDWebApp'
 * Debug mode: on
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on http://localhost:5555
6. Copy and Paste the http address into your web browser of choice

If this is all done correctly, you should be at the web app. Now:
1. Input parameters. This can be done by either uploading a .csv file, or clicking the checkbox. If you upload a file, though, you'll need to enter "Concentration in titration" manually
2. Open the acid titration file (.RPT only)
3. Open the base titration file (.RPT only)
4. Click the "Generate BC Curve" Button
5. Make any changes you want to the pH Electrode, Trim Beginning, or Trim End that you want
6. Click the "Use adjC" checkbox
7. Click the "Model BC Curve"
